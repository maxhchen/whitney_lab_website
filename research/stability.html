			<h2> Serial Dependence and the Continuity Field </h2>
			<p>
				Visual input often arrives in a noisy and discontinuous stream, owing to head and eye movements,
				occlusion, lighting changes, and many other factors. Yet the physical world is generally stable;
				objects and physical characteristics rarely change spontaneously. How then does the human visual
				system capitalize on continuity in the physical environment over time? We believe that there is a
				'continuity field' in which similar objects seen within a 15-second time frame are visually merged
				together to smooth out what would otherwise be a jittery perception of object features. This means
				that the visual system may be sacrificing accuracy for the sake of stable perception using a
				phenomenon known as serial dependence, or sequential dependence.
			</p>
			<p>
				From Fischer and Whitney (Nature Neuroscience, 2014). Using an orientation judgment task, we were
				able to find that visual perception in humans in serially, or sequentially, dependent, meaning that
				the visual system uses prior and present input to inform perception at the present moment. Subjects
				viewed a series of randomly oriented gratings, as shown above, and reported the perceived orientation
				of each grating using an adjustment response. We found that perceived orientation was strongly and
				systematically attracted toward orientations seen over the last several seconds. Moreover, this effect
				was modulated by attention and was spatially tuned, occurring more strongly for successive stimuli
				that appeared nearby in space. This perceptual serial dependence is the basis for a previously
				unknown spatially and temporally tuned operator - the continuity field - that could facilitate
				perceptual continuity of orientation information over time. Although this bias manifests as a
				misperception, or perceptual error, it is adaptively imitating the stability of objects in the
				world to create visual continuity.
			</p>
			<p>
				From Liberman, Fischer & Whitney (Current Biology, 2014). Not only do we see perceptual serial
				dependence in orientation judgments, but we have also seen that the perception of face identity
				is systematically biased towards identities seen up to several seconds prior. In a similar
				experiment to the one described above, we presented a random series of faces drawn from an
				identity morph continuum and measured the perceived identity of each face. A random target
				face was presented and each subject was asked to adjust a random face on the continuum to
				match the target face. The sequence of the experiment is pictured here in a short video clip.
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to determine whether serial dependence operates on the level of identity, and not just
				low-level features, we also manipulated the viewpoint of the sequentially presented faces.
				We found that identity perception is, in fact, serially dependent across different face viewpoints.
				These results are consistent with a continuity field and show that the perception of faces, and not
				just features, is serially dependent. Therefore, the continuity field is object-selective, surviving
				changes in viewpoint, and reflects a mechanism that produces serially dependent perception of objects
				for the purpose of visual stability.
