			<h2> Localization of Moving Objects </h2>
			<p>
				We use vision to localize objects around us with barely a second thought. However, the process is
				incredibly complex in ways that are still subjects of active research. For example, the brain works
				at a finite speed -- signals from the eyes need some time to arrive in the visual cortex for
				processing. During that time, objects in motion continue to move. How, then, are we still able
				to catch a fastball, or avoid people in a crowd?

				<p>
					From Whitney & Cavanagh (2000). The display shows two pairs of linear gratings appearing to
					move toward or away from each other. When fixating at the center, the top circles look closer
					than the bottom circles; however, the top and bottom circles are aligned. This demonstrates
					that the direction of motion affects the perceived position of a moving stimulus.

				<p>
					From Whitney et al. (2008). Here we see two dots moving toward each other that bounce in
					physical alignment. Most observers perceive the bounce locations to be misaligned (the dot
					on top appears shifted to the left or to the right of the one on the bottom). The misalignment
					is entirely a visual illusion caused by the motion of the dot. The perceived position of
					a moving object depends on the objectâ€™s motion and the motion of other objects in the scene,
					and this affects our everyday vision. A real-world example of how this causes a perceptual
					error applies to professional tennis referees, which players could exploit to their advantage.

			<h2> Physical vs. perceived position </h2>
			<p>
				Like so much of visual perception, visual localization happens in the brain rather than in the eyes.
				As a result, the perceived positions of objects and their physical, or retinal, positions, are not
				always the same. These discrepancies, or illusions, are not "defects" in your visual system. Rather,
				the processes underlying them have evolved to help us see better in everyday situations. Many of
				these processes work together in the brain to determine where we see things.
			</p>
			<h2> Echolocation </h2>
			<p>
				Not everybody can use vision to sense their environment. About 45 million people are blind worldwide,
				with three times that number visually impaired. Blind people use many strategies to navigate their
				environment or identify objects around them. Some use active echolocation, similarly to bats and
				dolphins, in which they emit tongue clicks and interpret the reflected echoes to aid in navigation
				and object recognition. We are interested in the behavioral, perceptual, and neural processes
				underlying echolocation in blind and sighted humans.
